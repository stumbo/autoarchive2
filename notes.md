2020-05-26 Need to get dialog box working correctly.  Button appears in box 
but does not open - instead an error occurs.

2020-05-28 Look at extension pages.  This appears to be the right approach

2020-07-20:  Refocus on rewriting the HTML pages.  Move to standard html and use Thunderbird's css for getting a 
consistent look and feel.

2020-07-21:  Use Photon style guide, find components at:  https://protocol.mozilla.org/patterns/atoms/buttons.html#
Need to convert for css to scss, find default sytle sheets at(?):  https://github.com/thundernest/style-guide/tree/master/_sass 

Done -copy existing scss files into my directory structure -- hacky right nogw
need to figure out the right way.  Also, need to bind the scss files correctly
so they are served up.
